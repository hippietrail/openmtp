## Introduction

### Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS.

Transferring files between macOS and Android or any other MTP devices has always been a nightmare. There are a few File Transfer MTP apps which are available online but most of them are either too expensive or come with bad UI/UX. The official "Android File Transfer" app for macOS from Google comes with bugs, innumerable limitations, some of which include - not being able to transfer files larger than 4GB, frequent disconnections, unable to rename the folders or files on the android/MTP device. Most of the other apps available online use either Wi-Fi or ADB protocol to transfer the files, which is an extremely time-consuming process.

Countless searches to find an app to solve these problems and failing to find one made me restless. So, I took the leap and decided to create an app for us that could help us have a smooth and hassle-free file transfer process from macOS to Android/MTP devices. Created with the objective of giving back to the community, we can all use this app for free in this lifetime.

### Features

- Safe, Transparent and Open-Source
- Plug and Play via USB. No hassles, easy and instant connection
- Select between Internal Memory and SD Card
- Transfer multiple files, which can be larger than 4GB
- Dark mode
- Drag-and-drop support
- Split pane views for both Local Computer and Android device
- Choose between Grid and List view
- Use Keyboard Shortcuts to navigate through your files
- No collection of personally identifiable information

### Kalam Kernel

OpenMTP 3.0 features a new MTP kernel and it was written from scratch. It promises a file copy speed of 30 to 40 MB/s on low and mid range devices and 100 to 120 MB/s on higher end devices. The all new and powerful MTP kernel is named after [Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam 'Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam')

Check out the Go package which I've written to build Kalam Kernel: [github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx 'https://github.com/ganeshrvel/go-mtpx'). Feel free to raise PRs.

### System Requirements and Support

- To support macOS versions below Big Sur the Kalam kernel needs to be compiled on an older macOS machine every time there is an update, which practically is very difficult
- Only the latest 3 versions of macOS will receive the `Kalam` Kernel updates, which includes new device support, fixes, stability improvements. macOS Big Sur (11.0) or above will receive the above updates
- We have now officially retired the support for `Kalam` Kernel on macOS 10.13 (OS X High Sierra) and lower. Only the "Legacy" MTP mode will continue working on these outdated machines
- We will continue releasing updates for both `Intel` and `ARM64` machines

### Installation

- Download the [Mac Apple Silicon](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/?downloadApp=github&release=stable&platform=mac&arch=arm64 'Mac Apple Silicon') version
- Download the [Mac Intel Silicon](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/?downloadApp=github&release=stable&platform=mac&arch=x64 'Mac Intel Silicon') version
- Using Homebrew Cask

```shell
  # newer versions:
  brew install openmtp --cask
  # older versions:
  brew cask install openmtp
```

- Find the latest _dmg_ file in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp/releases 'GitHub Releases')

## Building from Source

Requirements: [Node.js v10](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 'Install Node.js v10'), [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git 'Install Git') and [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/ 'Install Yarn package manager')

### Clone

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp.git

$ cd openmtp

# install yarn
npm install -g yarn

# install sentry cli
npm -g i @sentry/cli
```

```shell
$ yarn
```

### Run

A fresh clone might throw _undefined state_ error. Run the following commands once to fix the issue.

```shell
# For Mac and Linux
$ UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS=1 npm run dev

# For Windows
$ set UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS=1 && npm run dev
```

```shell
# Development
$ yarn dev

# Pre-production
$ yarn start

```

### Debugging a Packaged app

```shell
# On terminal run
$ "/path/to/OpenMTP.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenMTP" --remote-debugging-port=6363
```

- Open a Chromium browser
- Input "about://inpsect" into the URL bar
- Add a new connection `localhost:6363`
- Inpect OpenMTP @ port `6363`

### Publishing using CI/CD:

- CodeMagic.io
  - Create a new App (Choose others -> Enter Electron)
  - Environment variables:
    - `APPLEID`: `<Apple developer account username>`
    - `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`: `<App-Specific Password>`
      - Log into your [Apple Account](https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage 'Apple Account')
      - Goto **Sign-In and Security > App-Specific Passwords**
      - Click on **Generate Password...**, enter a password label and click _Create_
      - Copy the displayed _app-specific-password_
    - `SENTRY_URL`: `https://sentry.io/`
    - `SENTRY_ORG`: `<Sentry Organization Name>`
    - `SENTRY_PROJECT`: `<Sentry Project>`
    - `SENTRY_TOKEN_ID`: `<Sentry Auth Token>`
      - Find it from here: [Auth Tokens](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens)
      - Scopes: `event:admin, event:read, member:read, org:read, project:read, project:releases, team:read`
    - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: `Personal access token`
      - Find it from here: [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
      - Scopes: `admin:gpg_key, admin:public_key, repo, user, workflow`
    - `CSC_LINK`:
      - Keychain -> `Default Keychains` menu in the left -> Login -> My Certificates
      - Search for `Developer ID Application` in the top search bar
        - If there are no results for the `Developer ID Application`, for the organization, create one from here: [Apple Developer Certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add)
        - Follow these steps to get the Apple Developer certifcate installed on the local machine [Obtaining-an-Apple-Developer-ID-Certificate-for-macOS-Provisioning](https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Obtaining-an-Apple-Developer-ID-Certificate-for-macOS-Provisioning?language=en_US&ui-force-components-controllers-recordGlobalValueProvider.RecordGvp.getRecord=1)
      - Search for `Developer ID Application` in the top search bar
      - Expand `Developer ID Application: <User Name> (XXXYYYZZZ)`
      - See if the private key's name matches this: `Mac Developer ID Application: <User Name>`
        - Otherwise rename the private key as (right click -> get info) `Mac Developer ID Application: <User Name>`
        - Close the window
      - Right Click on the private key -> `Mac Developer ID Application: <User Name>`
      - Export `Mac Developer ID Application: <User Name>`
      - File name: `CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY.p12`
      - Enter Password. This is the `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, note this down
      - Run (this step doesn't work if you are using fig or ohmyzsh, use raw terminal):
        - `base64 -i CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY.p12 -o CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY.txt`
      - Copy the whole content of the file `CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY.txt`
      - Paste the content as the value for the field `CSC_LINK`
    - `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` is the password from the above step
    - `CODEMAGIC_AUTH_TOKEN_ID`: `<CodeMagic API Token>`
      - Find it from here: [Sidebar -> Teams -> Personal Account -> Integrations -> Codemagic API](https://codemagic.io/teams)
    - `CODEMAGIC_INTEL_X64_WORKFLOW_ID_PROD`: `<Prod codeMagic workflow id>`
      - Find the relevant workflow id from `codemagic.yaml`, (mostly `macos-intel-x64-build-prod`)
    - `CODEMAGIC_INTEL_X64_WORKFLOW_ID_DEV`: `<Dev codeMagic workflow id>`
      - Find the relevant workflow id from `codemagic.yaml`, (mostly `macos-intel-x64-build-dev`)
    - `PUBLISH_PROD_REPOSITORY`: `<Repository to publish the production app>`
    - `PUBLISH_DEV_REPOSITORY`: `<Repository to publish the dev app>`
    - `CODEMAGIC_PUBLISH_PROJECT_ID`: `<Codemagic intel project id>`
    - `PUBLISH_EMAIL`: `Email address to receive the updates on publish`

### Troubleshooting

#### Your device is not recognized

#### **node-mac-permissions** throws `Speech framework is not compatible with macOS < 10.15`

- On macOS <= 10.14.x (mojave) the `yarn install` will throw a npm-rebuild error
- To "test" or "debug" the app on macOS mojave:
  - remove the `node-mac-permissions` dependency from `package.json`
  - Add the ignorePlugin line to `default.plugins` in the file `webpack/config.base.js`
    - `new webpack.IgnorePlugin({ resourceRegExp: /^(node-mac-permissions)$/u }),`
  - WARNING: **DO NOT commit** these changes to the upstream!!
- The `NODE_MAC_PERMISSIONS_MIN_OS` constant defines the minimum OS version that is required to show the macos usage access permission popup
- For distribution make sure to build the app on a machine which is at least 10.15 (Catalina)
